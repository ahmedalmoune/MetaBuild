This repo contains both the front and back end for ease of access and demonstration purposes:  
- If you're trying to host on your own, then you'll need to have separate repos for the front-end and back-end. 
- If you're only interested in the back-end (i.e. the API), then you will need to inspect the code (views.py) to understand how to interact with it, as API end-point documentation are not available yet.
